# Learning MERN Stack

Just one of the things I'm learning: <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Free Code Camp Tutorial: on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@beaucarnes/learn-the-mern-stack-by-building-an-exercise-tracker-mern-tutorial-59c13c1237a1)

## Notes

**M** = MongoDB (We'll use Mongoose to make it easier to work with MongoDB, and we'll use MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database, but cloud.).
**E** = Express (makes it easier to work with Node.js).
**R** = React (for the frontend).
**N** = Node.js (for the server).
